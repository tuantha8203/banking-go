# Build and Fix

Incrementally fix build and type errors with minimal, safe changes.

## Step 1: Detect Build System

Identify the project's build tool and run the build:

banking-go is a Go workspace (`go.work`, no root module — never `go build ./...` from the repo root) plus a pnpm
workspace. Run, in order:

| Area | Build / check command | Delegate fixes to |
|------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Go (all modules) | `make build-go`, then `make vet`, then `make lint-go` | `go-build-resolver` agent |
| Web (apps/*, packages/*) | `make build-web`, then `make lint-web` (eslint + prettier + tsc) | `react-build-resolver` agent |
| Protobuf | `make lint-proto` | fix the `.proto`, then `make gen` |
| Generated code drift | `make gen-check` | `make gen` (never hand-edit `pkg/gen` or `api/openapi`) |

For a quick full pass use `make build` and `make lint`.

## Step 2: Parse and Group Errors

1. Run the build command and capture stderr
2. Group errors by file path
3. Sort by dependency order (fix imports/types before logic errors)
4. Count total errors for progress tracking

## Step 3: Fix Loop (One Error at a Time)

For each error:

1. **Read the file** — Use Read tool to see error context (10 lines around the error)
2. **Diagnose** — Identify root cause (missing import, wrong type, syntax error)
3. **Fix minimally** — Use Edit tool for the smallest change that resolves the error
4. **Re-run build** — Verify the error is gone and no new errors introduced
5. **Move to next** — Continue with remaining errors

## Step 4: Guardrails

Stop and ask the user if:
- A fix introduces **more errors than it resolves**
- The **same error persists after 3 attempts** (likely a deeper issue)
- The fix requires **architectural changes** (not just a build fix)
- Build errors stem from **missing dependencies** (need `make install`, a new Go module or a pnpm package) — ask before adding anything
- The error is a **depguard** violation (cross-module import, AD-3) or requires changing a contract (proto/OpenAPI)

## Step 5: Summary

Show results:
- Errors fixed (with file paths)
- Errors remaining (if any)
- New errors introduced (should be zero)
- Suggested next steps for unresolved issues

## Recovery Strategies

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Missing module/import | Check if the package is installed (`make install`); ask before `go get` (inside one module dir) or `npx -y pnpm@12.9.1 --filter <pkg> add` |
| Type mismatch | Read both type definitions; fix the narrower type |
| Circular dependency | Identify cycle with import graph; suggest extraction |
| Version conflict | Check `package.json` / `go.mod` of the affected module; lockfiles are never hand-edited |
| Build tool misconfiguration | Read config file; compare with working defaults |

Fix one error at a time for safety. Prefer minimal diffs over refactoring.
